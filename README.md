**Abstract**: *SpotONE: hot SPOTs ON protein complexes with Extremely randomized trees via sequence-only features is a new Machine-Learning (ML) predictor able to accurately classify protein Hot-Spots (HS) via sequence-only features. This algorithm shows an accuracy, AUROC, precision, recall and F1-score of 0.82, 0.83, 0.91, 0.82 and 0.85, respectively, in an independent testing set. The algorithm is deployed within a free-to-use webserver at http://moreiralab.com/resources/spotone, only requiring the user to submit a FASTA file with one or more protein sequences.*
